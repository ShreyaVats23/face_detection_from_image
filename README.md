# Face Detection using Machine Learning

*This project demonstrates a machine learning–based face detection system applied to a group image.*

## *Project Overview*

This image is a sample input/output from a machine learning computer vision project focused on face detection. It shows a group photograph used as test data, where a trained face-detection model has processed the image and identified human faces. Each detected face is highlighted with a green bounding box, and the total count (“Detected Faces: 9”) is displayed at the top, indicating the model’s inference result.

The screenshot appears to come from a development or notebook environment, demonstrating the successful application of a face detection algorithm (likely based on a classical method such as Haar Cascades or a modern CNN-based detector). The purpose of the image is to visually validate model performance by confirming that all visible faces in a multi-person scene are correctly detected.

## *Technologies Used*

* Python  
* OpenCV  
* Machine Learning / Computer Vision  

## *Sample Output*

*The image below shows the model detecting **9 faces** in a single image.*
